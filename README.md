I also ran an experiment where I let RNG play pokemon blue for 5 days straight at 100x speed. It never left Pallet town, but it got to level 100 so that's cool. (it always jumps down over the ledges before it can reach viridian). Todo, make a random inputter but don't ever move to tiles that are blocked/jump down??
